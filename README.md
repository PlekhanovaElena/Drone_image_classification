# Drone_image_classification
Landcover classification of drone imagery (RGB and Multispectral) using Random forest with superpixel postprocessing.

## Description

In this repository I only store the code. The data is taken from [Hilden](https://arcticdrones.org/) collection, which will be published soon.
The code is organized into 4 Jupyter notebooks and one Python script with functions:
* 0. - preprocessing of the images. Filling the gaps and resizing the images if needed.
* 1. - showing an example of landcover classification on one image
* 2. - classifying all the prepared in script 0. multispectral imagery
* 3. - classifying all the prepared in script 0. RGB imagery
* myfunctions - all the custom functions I used

## Visualization

If you want to quickly glance at how the analysis is done, just view the 1._ script. It contains images and descriptions of each step.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions!
